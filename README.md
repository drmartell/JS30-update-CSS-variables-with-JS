### 'Update CSS Variables with JS' exercise from [Wes Bos's free JavaScript30 course.](https://javascript30.com/)

This exercise is a vanilla JavaScript demonstration of updating CSS variables with JS.  Interesting that event listeners are needed for both the change event and the mousemove event to give an intuitive user experience.
